Simple logging middleware for aiogram version 3.x

`Hi, recently aiogram 3.0 was realesed and I faced with the problem of logging. 
I used integrated to aiogram middleware from aiogram.contrib module but it was deleted in newer version.
aiogram.logger for me sucks because of I can't log what does user entering to chat, and what kinda of callbacks does he send.
I decided to write some simple middleware that adds more info about user's updates.  Any advice or contributions are welcome!  I'm relatively new to this and would appreciate any input or pull requests you might have. Feel free to share your thoughts and improvements`
